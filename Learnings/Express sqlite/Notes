- express.static() makes your app access mime type files, and makes /public default for it
- In a form, input's id and label's for link them together. this id/for sets the value for that label(how does label for email, input id for email set email={input} in req.body)
- forEach may need a semi-colon
- learn about closing the sqlite database. Right now i am opening it and closing on exit events


Auth
- To protect routes, just use an express middleware and check if user/session exists.
- You can apply the middleware in index.js or in feedRouter.js . Index.js will protect everything starting with /feed. and feedRouter middleware will only apply to routes specified in the feedRouter file. 
- Defining feedRouter.use(auth) protects any route starting with /feed . ofc /feed is treated as / for this router
